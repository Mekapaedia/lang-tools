# lang-tools
Programming language prototyping tools for [heylang](https://github.com/Mekapaedia/heylang).
Currently doesn't do anything, but uses [parglare](https://github.com/igordejanovic/parglare).
Based off of the work by [Mike Daines](https://github.com/mdaines) on [Grammophone](https://github.com/mdaines/grammophone) as well as the resources available on [Robin Cockett's website](http://pages.cpsc.ucalgary.ca/~robin/).
